|TIP Take a few moments to customize your environment. You'll be in it for the next 60, 7080 minutes and if you don't like the light theme on Jupiter labs or you wanna work with Visual Studio code or you wanna turn on the mode and you know what you're doing take a moment to customize it.

Take a quick tour take your way through the tabs on your right, you can complete the entire lab solely in your primary tab on the Wright i.e. Jupiter labs. Your first Jupiter notebook will give you a few tips to how to use Jupiter notes if you've never used them before and we also have a reference document at the end.
